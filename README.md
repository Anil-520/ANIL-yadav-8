import os

Define suspicious file extensions (for demo)
suspicious_ext = [".exe", ".bat", ".vbs", ".scr"]

def scan_directory(path):
    print(f"Scanning directory: {path}\n")
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
        for file in files:
            if file.lower().endswith(tuple(suspicious_ext)):
                print(f"[!] Suspicious file found: {os.path.join(root, file)}")
    print("\n‚úÖ Scan complete!")

# Example: scan current folder
